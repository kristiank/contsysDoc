A health thread can include healthcare activities, health conditions, healthcare activity planning, activity management, evaluations and assessments. Thereby, all information needed for continuity of care for an individual subject of care can be covered by a health concern.

NOTE 2 health concerns can be constructed to support continuity of care for healthcare processes, clinical processes and accumulations/associations of clinical processes. This means that concerns can relate to episodes of care, contacts, chronic disease management, multiple chronic disease management, etc.

NOTE 3 health concerns can be represented and labelled in EHR as extracts or components.

NOTE 4 health concern is closely related to the “concern tracking” based on HL7 standards."""@en .
