Formal Ontology for continuity of care based on **International Standard ISO 13940** 

Gulliford et al. (2006) describe “Continuity of care is concerned with the quality of care over time”. There are two aspects of this. One is based on the patient's experience of a 'continuous caring relationship' with the healthcare professional. Another one is based on a system of care where seamless service needed to provide through integration, coordination and interoperable information systems.  

Objectives:

**Define Datatype**
**Test** OWL ontolgoy using real dataset.
